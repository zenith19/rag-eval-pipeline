"""The literature review, as data.

Every entry is a reference from the thesis bibliography ("Developing Deep Learning
Models for Coreference Resolution in Bengali", Saarland, 2026) that is freely
available. Titles are copied verbatim from the bibliography — URLs are *resolved*
by scripts/resolve_corpus.py rather than typed by hand, then verified to return a
real PDF before being committed to scripts/corpus_manifest.csv.

Excluded deliberately:
  - already in data/: Lee 2017, Joshi 2020, Rohan 2023, Mishra 2024, Khanuja 2021,
    Lee/Tang/Lin 2019, Bhattacharjee 2022 (7 refs)
  - paywalled, need manual access: Sikdar 2016, Mitkov 2014, Recasens & Hovy 2011,
    Kuhn 1955, McCloskey & Cohen 1989, Holm 1979 (6 refs)
  - not papers / unsuitable: Ethnologue (website), OntoNotes LDC catalog (data
    release), Jurafsky & Martin (600-page textbook would dominate the corpus)
